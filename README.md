# tsp-subtour-elimination

This project focuses on implementing and understanding subtour elimination techniques for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), particularly the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson (DFJ) and the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) approaches.

## Overview

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city. Subtour elimination is a technique used to prevent the formation of suboptimal solutions in TSP algorithms.

This project provides implementations of subtour elimination techniques based on the DFJ and MTZ formulations. By studying and experimenting with these approaches, users can gain a deeper understanding of how subtour elimination works and its significance in optimizing TSP solutions.

## Features

* Implementation of DFJ subtour elimination algorithm
